At PNC, we provide many types of loans for our customers. In the attached (fictitious) dataset, there are three types of loans represented, each with an associated Risk Score, Percent of Principal Remaning, and a Probability of Default score. Please use this data to complete the following exercise.

`@instructions`
For each type of loan and risk score, we want to know how each is performing both within and across groups. 
- Summarize the results of each group
- Determine the effect that loan type and risk score have on the performance of loans (i.e. remaining two variables). 
- Present all relevant (or interesting) findings in the form of plots or tables. Be prepared to explain your results.

When you are finished, copy and paste your code into the Skype chat and send to the interviewer.
